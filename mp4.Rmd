You’ve heard it said: no movies are original anymore. It certainly feels that way. [Just this year](http://uproxx.com/movies/2017-sequels/) we have Cars 3, a new Guardians of the Galaxy, a Beauty and the Beast remake, the *ninth* Planet of the Apes movie, and the latest installment in the Star Wars franchise. However, in reality, far fewer of these movies are released than may appear. 

In a 2016 [Tylt poll](https://thetylt.com/entertainment/are-there-too-many-hollywood-reboots-and-sequels), the vast majority (79.3%) of respondents said that there are “#TooManyReboots.” [^1] We set out to determine if this was actually true, or if the number of unoriginal movies is being blown out of proportion. As it turns out, we are not even at peak sequel or remake production, and when considering the fact that more movies are being made now than ever before, unoriginal films make up a significantly smaller proportion of the movie industry than in the past.

In order to determine the number of unoriginal movies produced, we pulled data on all feature length movies released in the past century tagged with the keywords `remake`, `reboot`, or `sequel` in the IMDb.[^2]

Remakes generally reference projects that keep the most important features of an older movie, such as characters and story, and remake it using different actors, more advanced film techniques, and special effects. Remakes tend to add new, socially relevant dialogue to appeal to modern audiences. Think Scarface, based on a 1932 movie of the same name.

Reboots are complete overhauls of the source material–a reimagining of a story. Typically, the source is stripped down to its most core elements, and a new story is built predominantly from scratch. Think "Batman Begins" or the 2009 movie my family lovingly refers to as "Star Trek Kids."

Sequels continue the story of, or expand upon, earlier films. These often have the same characters, and similar settings, as the films they follow. Major film franchises have lots of sequels-Star Wars, Marvel, and Pirates of the Caribbean, to name a few.

# Query to find all movies tagged with remake, reboot, or sequel

remakes_reboots_sequels <- db %>%
  dbGetQuery(
    "SELECT kw.id, kw.keyword, t.title, t.production_year 
     FROM imdb.keyword kw
     JOIN movie_keyword mkw ON kw.id = mkw.keyword_id
     JOIN title t ON t.id = mkw.movie_id
     LEFT JOIN movie_info mi ON mi.movie_id = t.id
     LEFT JOIN movie_info mi2 ON mi2.movie_id = t.id
     WHERE kw.id IN (82, 1134, 20757) AND t.kind_id = 1
	AND t.production_year BETWEEN 1917 AND 2017
     AND mi.info_type_id = 1 AND mi.info >= 80
     GROUP BY t.id;")

# 82, 1134, and 20757 are the keyword id numbers that correspond to the keywords remake, reboot, and sequel.
    
#This query is optimized because we use the primary keys in the keyword and title tables to join. When we use "where" to select the IDs from title and keyword, SQL only has to look at 1 and 3 rows, respectively. On movie keyword, keyword id is indexed, so we only have to look at 32 rows when referencing that table! Therefore, this query is extremely fast.


remakes_by_year <- remakes_reboots_sequels %>%
  filter(!is.na(production_year)) %>%
  group_by(production_year) %>%

remakes_by_year_gathered <- remakes_by_year %>%
  gather(key = "type", value = "count", reboot:sequel)

#This code puts the information pulled from the query into a form that allows us to graph the information for sequels, remakes, and reboots all on one single graph.

#Note that the movie_keyword table includes keywords for remake, sequel, AND reboot (unlike the link_type table), so here we can see reboots as well.

According to the IMDb data, the numbers of unoriginal movies released in 2017 were:

	Sequels: 54
	Remakes: 9
	Reboots: 2

These might seem like pretty big numbers when you consider how many movies you watch per year--who has time to go see 54 sequels? That's more than one movie a week!--but when you look at the history of these unoriginal movies, the only type currently at its peak is reboots, with two films in 2017. Remakes and sequels both reached their peak long ago: in 1999 and 1994, respectively. We have fewer sequels and remakes being made now, and if we take into consideration the fact that the movie industry has grown significantly, these unoriginal films make up a smaller percentage of the movie industry than they ever have.

As seen above, the highest percentage of unoriginal movies occurred around 1920. Even in the biggest year for unoriginality, sequels, remakes, and reboots only made up just over 10% of movies. 

Over the last few decades, the percentage of unoriginal movies has been in considerable decline. This year, only around 1% of all movies made were unoriginal. 

An big reason for this is the quickly increasing number of movies produced. A hundred years ago, around 50 movies were released annually. This year, there were over 7,000. Sequel, remake and reboot production just can’t seem keep up with the ever growing number of movies.

So if there really aren’t that many unoriginal movies being made, why does it seem like they’re everywhere?

There is certainly a reason that sequels, remakes, and reboots fill our thoughts so much, and that reason is **money**. Of the top 20 [highest grossing movies](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/) of all time, only 4 can be classified as truly original: “Avatar,” “Titanic,” “Frozen,” and “Minions.” [^3]


```{r}
url <- "http://www.boxofficemojo.com/alltime/world/"
html_bom <- read_html(url)

tables <- html_bom %>%
  html_nodes("table")

top_grossing <- tables[[3]] %>%
  html_table(header = TRUE)

colnames(top_grossing)[4] <- "Gross (millions)"

kable(top_grossing[1:20, -(5:8) ], caption = "Top Grossing Movies of All Time")

```


\s `^ = Movie made its gross over multiple releases.`


The success of unoriginal films becomes even more impressive when considering [individual years](https://stephenfollows.com/how-original-are-hollywood-movies/). In 2007, 2013, and 2014, the top ten grossing movies were all “derived from a pre-existing movie or source.” [^4]

We like things we are familiar with, something known as the [Mere Exposure Effect](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sapient-nature/201201/familiarity-breeds-enjoyment). Familiarity with a movie’s premise or characters makes us more likely to see it. Additionally, unoriginal movies require a lot less work on the part of the viewer if they are familiar with the original. Many people use movies as a way to relax, so having less work figuring out the plot and characters can be appealing. 

It’s no wonder, then, that unoriginal movies fill our thoughts. These are the blockbuster movies that bring in the most revenue, are the most seen, are the most heavily advertised, and are therefore the most talked about.

If moviegoers continue to purchase tickets to unoriginal movies, companies will continue to produce them because there’s little risk involved. Producers can predict how large their audience will be, there’s already a lot of time put into character development, and there’s already a dedicated fan base they know will go watch the movie when it’s released. Who wouldn’t make a movie guaranteed to be a success?

Moviegoers are causing their own frustration. The only way to reduce the number of unoriginal movies made and reduce the level of annoyance is to stop watching them. If you’re someone who votes “#TooManyReboots,” it might be time to consider watching some indie movies instead. You’re not likely to get anywhere by streaming into the theaters every time a new Star Wars movie gets announced.
